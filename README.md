# Customer Churn Prediction

##  Overview
A full-stack Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn. Built with Python and deployed via Flask, this tool provides both UI-based and API-driven churn predictions.

##  Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, transformed, and prepared real-world customer data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Trained classification algorithms (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoostâ€”update based on your project specifics).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Flask Deployment**:
  - **Web UI**: Allows users to input data and receive churn predictions.
  - **REST API**: Enables programmatic access to churn predictions.
- **Optional**: Add model interpretability (e.g. SHAP, feature importance) if implemented.

##  Technologies
- **Core Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Flask (plus others as used)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable), Git & GitHub, any deployment service (Heroku, Render, etc.)
